## Abstract
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image classification and pattern recognition. In this report, we provide an overview of the theoretical background behind CNNs, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and activation functions. We discuss the architecture of a typical CNN and the different types of layers involved. We also highlight some of the popular CNN models that have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various image classification tasks. Finally, we compare the performance of CNNs with other image classification methods and discuss the limitations of CNNs.

## I. Introduction and Overview
Image classification is an essential task in computer vision, with applications ranging from object detection to facial recognition. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art method for image classification, outperforming traditional machine learning algorithms on various benchmarks. CNNs have a hierarchical architecture, consisting of multiple layers of convolution, pooling, and activation functions that learn feature representations from the input images. In this report, we provide a comprehensive overview of CNNs, including the theoretical background, architecture, and popular models used in image classification.

## II. Theoretical Background
CNNs are inspired by the visual cortex of the human brain and have been shown to be highly effective in image classification tasks. CNNs are composed of multiple layers, with each layer consisting of a set of learnable filters that convolve with the input image to extract features. The convolutional layers are followed by pooling layers that downsample the feature maps to reduce computational complexity. The activation functions introduce non-linearity into the model and allow for complex feature representations.

One of the key advantages of CNNs is their ability to learn hierarchical representations of the input images. The initial layers of the network learn simple features such as edges and lines, while the deeper layers learn more complex features such as shapes and textures. The output of the final layer is a probability distribution over the different classes, and the class with the highest probability is chosen as the predicted label.

Several popular CNN architectures have been proposed, including LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG, Inception, and ResNet. These models vary in the number of layers, filter sizes, and network connectivity. For example, VGG consists of 19 layers and has a small filter size of 3x3, while ResNet has more than 100 layers and introduces skip connections to prevent the vanishing gradient problem.

CNNs have been shown to outperform other traditional image classification methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), decision trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) on various benchmarks. However, CNNs also have some limitations, such as their high computational complexity and the need for large amounts of training data.

## III. Algorithm Implementation and Development
### A. Convolutional Layers
The convolutional layers are the core building blocks of CNNs. Each convolutional layer consists of a set of learnable filters that convolve with the input image to extract features. The filters are represented by a set of weights that are learned during the training process.
