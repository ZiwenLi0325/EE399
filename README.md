# Homework X: Least-Squares Fitting

## Abstract

In this homework, we explore various methods for performing least-squares fitting on a dataset using a given model function. First, we implement an algorithm to find the optimal values for the model parameters that minimize the least-squares error. We then sweep through different combinations of parameter values to generate a 2D loss landscape and identify the number of minima. Finally, we compare the performance of different models (linear, quadratic, and 19th degree polynomial) on training and test data.
